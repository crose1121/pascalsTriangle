//To build out this triangle, we need to take note of a few things.
// Each row starts and ends with a 1.
// Inside each row, between the 1s, each digit is the sum of the two digits immediately above it.
// We can use this pattern to build new rows starting with row 3. But we canâ€™t use it to build the first or second rows.
// Each row is represented as an array; we need to output the entire triangle as an array of these rows (ie an array of arrays).
